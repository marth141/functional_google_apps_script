# functional_google_apps_script
Just some Google Apps Script I'm happy with.

With a reminder list like...

| Employee | Employee Email       | Last Sent |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| John Doe | john.doe@company.com |           |
| Jane Doe | jane.doe@company.com |           |
| ...      | ...                  | ...       |

Someone would be able to send some emails and set a trigger to have emails send automatically 2, 3, or 14 days after the initial Last Sent date.

Configuration table would look like...
|          |                      |
|----------|----------------------|
| reply to | john.doe@company.com |
| subject  | Example Subject      |
| body     | Example Body         |
