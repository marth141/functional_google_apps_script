# nice_google_apps_script

Just some Google Apps Script I'm happy with.

A lot of it was written after coming off a while of writing Elixir.

I wanted to try a lot more functional approaching and writing in much more Elixirish way with Google Apps Script.

The project ended up using `class` like `defmodule`.

So I'm proud of how it turned out and hope that it helps someone else with thinking about how to write Google Apps Script.

# Setup Commands

1. Run `npm install -g @google/clasp` to install clasp.
2. Run `npm install` to get `@types/google-apps-script` for coding.
3. Run `clasp login` to login to your Google.
4. Update the `.clasp.json` with your script id.
5. Use `clasp create` create your apps script project.

Any critique is welcome!
