# CRUD with Google Sheets

Hello! This folder contains an example—based off the nice skeleton—of CRUD.

CRUD is Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

All of these are basic operations to be done on a database. Google Sheets just don't make it easy.

# File Legend

- `src/Code.ts`
  - Contains test functions that showcase CRUD operations.
- `src/example_form_response_spreadsheet.ts`
  - Abstracts the spreadsheet as a custom spreadsheet class.
  - Provides the official spreadsheet class to child sheets.
- `src/example_form_response_spreadsheet/example_form_response_sheet.ts`
  - Abstracts the spreadsheet's sheet as a custom class extending the custom spreadsheet class.
  - Contains all of the CRUD functions.
- `src/example_form_response_spreadsheet/structs/form_response.ts`
  - Abstracts the spreadsheet's sheet's table data as a class extending the built-in object class.
  - This makes it easier to write Google Apps Script code using an IDE; Makes the headers accessible with Intellisense.
